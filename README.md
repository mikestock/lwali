Long Wavelength Array Lightning Imager

The Long Wavelength Array (LWA) is an astronomical radio telescope with arrays located in California and New Mexico 
(maybe in more places by the time you get around to reading this).  The arrays operate at VHF frequencies between around 
10 MHz to 90 MHz, with nominally 256 antennas distributed over a 100 meter circular array.  Details of this telescope 
can be found in the usual places

Because the telescope operates in the VHF band, it can and does see radio emission from lightning.  The codes included 
in this repository are tools designed to use LWA TBF observations to image lightning flashes.  The techniques used for 
lightning imaging tend to differ quite drastically from those used for astronomical sources because the radiation source 
is not static, and the integration times are very very short.
